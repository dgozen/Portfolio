				<img id="me" src="images/Duygu1.PNG" alt="Duygu Gözen photo" />
				<p>
					I am 100% human code with a <span>kind soul</span>, sense of
					<span>humour</span> that people seem to like, slightly crazy (ok maybe
					a bit more then slightly...) and a full on Star Wars geek. And
					probably <span class="brown"> 25% coffee</span>.
				</p>
				<p>
					I've always been super <span>curious</span>, trying to solve the
					mistery behind things. My particular
					<span>fascination with code</span> started during an attempt to
					breathe life in to an ancient laptop of mine with a new system called
					Linux. (Technically Linux wasn't new, I just did not know it existed.)
					Thus, Linux opened my eyes to a whole new world of possibilities with
					code that, quite frankly, I was very ignorant toward... I fell in love
					with coding and started learning <span>Frontend Development</span> at
					<span>Hyper Island</span>.
				</p>
				<p>
					I could go on and on about everything I've learned at Hyper from
					<span>team building</span> soft skills, <span>SCRUM</span> working
					methods to various technologies such as, <span>Next.js</span> or
					<span>Headless CMS</span> but I think I'll show you instead. If a
					picture is worth a thousand words then wouldn't a video be worth... a
					million?

				<p>
					This is one of the more innovative projects that I am proud to have
					done. My team and I took a pdf file and transformed it in to a very
					futuristic, intuitive and interactive feature for Global Resilience
					Partnership's new website. React.js and a small API was used to create
					this website. You can view the live desktop version

				<h3 id="calendar">< A Very Accessible Gym App for Mobile /></h3>
				<img id="calendarMedia" src="./videos/gymapp.gif" / alt="a gym app

				<p>
					Today many developers are sooo concerned with making their websites
					"<span class="p">p</span><span class="r">r</span
					><span class="e">e</span><span class="t">t</span
					><span class="t2">t</span><span class="y">y</span>" that they forget
					the most important factor when coding: ACCESSIBILTY! Here is my
					prototype for a gym mobile app, created with React.js. Its UI was
					designed for motor function disabilities and dyslexia. It was also
					coded in such a way that screen readers can easily navigate through it
					making it possible for anyone to access the app. You can find the
					complete accessibility documentation details on

				<h3 id="quotey">< Quotey /></h3>
				<img id="quoteyMedia" src="./videos/quotey.gif" />
				<p>
					Here is a "lets just have fun" kind of project that I coded using only
					JavaScript Vanilla. It is a simple game that uses websockets from
					socket.io but has a very awsome twist. You can hear the characters'
					voices and you can actually chat as these characters with others on
					multi player mode. If no one else is online you can always play the
					single player mode to phone prank someone! If you are on Firefox make
					sure you give permission for playback! Go head play the game

					or take a look at the code in

				<h3 id="wwt">< WWT's Design System /></h3>
				<img
					id="wwtMedia"
					src="./images/design.png"
					alt="We Were There design system picture"
				/>
				<p>
					Not everything is just about writing code. It is also important to
					know how to create a design system before building a website or an app
					to make sure everyline of code has a purpose. Also, it really makes
					adjustments or updates very easy in the future. This was a design
					system created in Figma for WWT's (We Were There) landing page to help
					deliever their message and also increase their conversion rate.
